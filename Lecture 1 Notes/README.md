### Importance of Generative Adversarial Networks
___
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is one of the most rapidly growing research field in AI. In fact, Yann LeCun, the director of Facebook AI Research stated on Quora twice, he thinks that **Adversarial Training** or **GAN** is the most interesting idea in ML in recent years. Yann LeCun is a legend in the field of ML, and his opinion is the testament to GAN's awesomeness üëç
